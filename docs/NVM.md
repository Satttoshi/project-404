# Node Version Management

This project uses a specific Node.js version defined in the `.nvmrc` file.

## Getting Started

We use [NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to ensure everyone uses the same Node.js version.

After cloning the repository:

```bash
# Switch to the correct Node.js version
nvm use
```

This will automatically read the version from the `.nvmrc` file.

## Troubleshooting

If you don't have NVM installed, please visit [NVM GitHub page](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for installation instructions.
